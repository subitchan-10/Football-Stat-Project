This **project**, titled “Football Match and Team Performance Analysis Across Seasons and Leagues,” focuses on exploring and visualizing football data to uncover meaningful insights about team performance, league characteristics, and match trends. The main objective is to analyze how various football statistics — such as goals, shots, fouls, corners, yellow and red cards — change across different seasons and leagues while identifying patterns that influence match outcomes. The analysis also investigates the relationships between different variables, such as the correlation between shots and goals or goals scored and goals conceded, to understand how team efficiency and playing style differ across leagues.

The ## project## uses two primary datasets: a match-level dataset containing information such as match date, teams, goals, fouls, cards, and odds; and an Elo ratings dataset, which provides team ratings based on historical performance. The data was preprocessed by converting date columns, mapping league codes (e.g., F1, E0) to full league names, and aggregating statistics for each team and season. This helped ensure consistency and clarity across the analysis.
A wide variety of graphs and statistical methods were employed to make the findings easily interpretable. These include bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, boxplots, area plots, correlation heatmaps, and kernel density plots (KDE). Each graph is clearly labeled with appropriate titles and axis names, ensuring that the visualizations communicate insights effectively. The project also includes an interactive dashboard built using Streamlit, allowing users to select specific seasons and leagues to explore the data dynamically.
Through this analysis, several important insights emerged. For example, teams with a high number of shots but fewer goals often exhibit poor scoring efficiency. A high number of yellow or red cards reflects an aggressive playing style, which might increase the risk of disciplinary actions. Correlation analysis revealed that a strong positive relationship between goals scored and conceded could indicate that attacking teams often compromise defensively, while a negative correlation suggests teams that balance both offense and defense effectively. The analysis also showed how home advantage and scoring trends have evolved over time, highlighting differences between leagues such as the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and Ligue 1.
Overall, this project demonstrates how data analytics can be applied to sports to uncover performance trends and tactical patterns. It provides value to coaches, analysts, and fans by offering a clear, data-driven understanding of football performance across multiple leagues and seasons. The project also showcases the integration of data preprocessing, visualization, and interactive tools to create a comprehensive analytical platform. In the future, the project could be extended by incorporating player-level data, expected goals (xG) metrics, or machine learning models for predictive analysis.
